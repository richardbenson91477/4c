Foresee (4c) language
===

## WIP programming language  
### Foresee: to see beforehand
Still in the design phase - based on patterns in the implementation and
coding style used in the nitro4c (Nitrogen for C) engine - something
that I foresaw that I would do 
(although I didn't foresee that the new language would be called 4c when
I named the engine nitro4c :-)
